# Separation of Conjoined Twins Simulation in Unreal Engine

This project is a simulation designed to depict the process of separating conjoined twins within the Unreal Engine environment. It features a collection of actors, a skeleton model representing conjoined twins, and several organ models to illustrate the surgical procedure involved in the separation.

## Overview

The simulation provides a visual representation of the surgical steps required to separate conjoined twins. It is a proof of concept involving only the skeleton model, the organ models and the twin models.
## Components

### Actors

- **Conjoined Twins Skeleton:** A detailed skeleton model representing the conjoined twins, providing an anatomically accurate representation of their physical structure.

- **Organ Models:** Various organ models are included to demonstrate the intricate nature of the surgery and the careful separation of shared organs.

### Simulation Environment

- **Operating Room Setting:** The simulation takes place in a futureistic operating room environment, complete with equipment, and lighting.

## Features

- **Realistic Rendering:** Utilizes Unreal Engine's powerful rendering capabilities to create lifelike visuals and textures for enhanced realism.

- **Dynamic Interactivity:** Allows users to engage with the simulation dynamically, simulating the hands-on nature of surgical procedures.

- **Educational Tool:** Designed as an educational resource for medical professionals and students to learn about the complexities of conjoined twin separation surgeries.

## Usage

1. Launch the simulation within the Unreal Engine environment.
2. Navigate through the operating room scene.
3. Interact with various elements, such examining organ models.

## Dependencies

- **Unreal Engine:** The project is developed using Unreal Engine, requiring the engine to run the simulation.
- **Blender:** Some of the 3D models used in the simulation may have been created or modified using Blender, an open-source 3D modeling software.
